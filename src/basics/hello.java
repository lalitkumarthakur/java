// Notes

// Our computer does not understand java code directly so it needs to be converted.
// That why our compiler converts Java code into Byte code so that JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
// can understand and make our OS then hardware understand the code and perform our desired output.
// Refer to this diagram below - 

// We(source code) -> Compiler ->
// Byte Code -> JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
// OS -> Hardware -> Return back.
